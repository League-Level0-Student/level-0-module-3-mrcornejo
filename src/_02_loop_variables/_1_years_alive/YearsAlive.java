		//the loop keep on going 15 times.
		// there is more than one way to do this.
		// you need a loop control variable that controls
		// how many times the loop repeats.  you could
		// have it go from 1 to 15.  then have a separate
		// variable that has the year.
		// OR your loop control variable could be the year!
		
		// let's say for example, I've lived from 2000 to 2021.
		// that could be my loop control variable.  try writing
		// the loop code and if you're not sure what i mean,
		// i'll show you :)ok
		//System.out.print("1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15");
		// this does not use the power of loop code!  
		// for example, what if you were 75 years old?  this
		// would be annoying to code...
		// need help?yes  ok.  your loop below will repeat 15
		// times because loop control variable i goes from 1 to 15
		// BUT inside the loop your code does nothing! change the 15 
		//because it's to big? no.  inside the loop, at least
		// print the current value of i and maybe a space  no.
		// i'll help you
		
		for (int i=2006; i<=2021; i++ ) {
			;	// do nothing here... you need to fix this
			System.out.println(i + " ");
			//im confused is line 31 not the loop
			// yes it is the loop control code
			// ok let me fix the code and show you what i mean
			// now run the code  
			// let's say you now turned 16.  how would you
			// update the code to print 1 ... 16
			// do you understand so far? so i is 1 and it 
			//stops were <= because its were the loop stops
			// yes.  i is doing "two jobs" - it is the loop control
			// variable that controls how many times the loop
			// repeats AND it represents your age!
			
			// make sense so far?  so now we're going to
			// change the meaning of i to represent the 
			// YEARS YOU'VE BEEN ALIVe.
			// what year were you born in?  
			// YES!!  you see how that works?yes  ok you're done
			// with this program.
