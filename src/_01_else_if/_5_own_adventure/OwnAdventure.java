		// one last thing: what will you say if the user

		// what will you say if the family is coming to them?
		//get ready!!
		
		// and what if they say no?
		//which holiday do you prefer halloween or easter?
		// great choices.  so if they answer halloween,
		// what message should your code print out?
		//halloween is a fun and a time to be crazy with costumes 
		// for easter, what message?
		//easter reminds me of pastel colors
